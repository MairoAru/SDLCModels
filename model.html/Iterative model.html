            <td>In iterative model we can only create a high-level design of the application before we actually begin to build the product and define the design solution for the entire product. Later on we can design and built a skeleton version of that, and then evolved the design based on what had been built.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>In iterative model we are building and improving the product step by step. Hence we can track the defects at early stages. This avoids the downward flow of the defects.</td>
            <td>Costly system architecture or design issues may arise because not all requirements are gathered up front for the entire lifecycle</td>
